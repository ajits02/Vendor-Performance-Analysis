# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
A complete end-to-end data analysis pipeline to evaluate and optimize vendor and inventory performance in a  retail environment using Python, SQL, Power BI, and statistical methods. 


Key Highlights : 


•  Automated Data Ingestion into SQLite using Python 

• SQL-based Summary Metrics for vendor performance 

• Exploratory Data Analysis with outlier detection & insights 

•  Profitability Analysis using Gross Profit, Margins, Turnover, etc.

•  Power BI Dashboard for executive-level visibility 

•  PDF Report summarizing business recommendations 

Business Objectives : 

• Identify underperforming brands for strategic action 

• Pinpoint vendors with low stock turnover or losses 

• Leverage bulk purchasing insights to reduce unit cost 

• Validate profitability differences statistically between vendor tiers 

• Reduce risk from vendor over-dependence 

Key Features  : 

• Business Problem: 

The company lacked insights into vendor and brand-level performance, leading to poor inventory 
decisions, pricing inefficiencies, and supply chain risk. 

• Core Business Questions Solved: 


 
Which brands need promotional or pricing adjustments due to low sales but high margins? 

Who are the top-performing vendors and brands in terms of sales? 

Which vendors account for the largest portion of purchase dollars? 

How dependent is the business on its top vendors? 

Does bulk purchasing reduce unit price, and what is the optimal volume? 

Which vendors have low inventory turnover (slow-moving stock)? 

How much capital is locked in unsold inventory per vendor? 

What are the 95% confidence intervals of profit margins across vendor groups? 

Is there a statistically significant difference in profitability between top and low-performing
